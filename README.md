# Conway's Game of Life
Authors: Aydin O'Leary (@zbwrm), Alex Butler (@lxbtlr), Sam Cabrera-Valencia (@SamCabV)

The goal of this project is to implement Conway's Game of Life in Verilog and use an FPGA to drive an LED matrix.
By the deadline, we landed somewhere between Minimum and Planned goals, as significant inroads were made on system integration with the FPGA

## Deliverables
### Minimum
 - Code a functional Verilog implementation of Conway's Game of Life
 - Code a functional Python implentation of Conway's Game of Life
### Planned
 - Create a functional small LED matrix that displays Conway's Game of Life driven by an FPGA
### Stretch
 - Implement different or user-defined cellular automaton rule sets
 - Use more colors
 - Drive larger LED matrices



## TODO
 - ~~Python implementation~~
 - ~~Solidify Verilog -> FPGA workflow (make LED light up)~~
 - ~~Verilog implementation~~
 - Drive LED matrix with Verilog
 - ~~Put Verilog implementation onto FPGA~~
