WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net row_reg[3]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin row_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell row_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net row_reg[4]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin row_reg[4]_LDC_i_1/O, cell row_reg[4]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net row_reg[5]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin row_reg[5]_LDC_i_1/O, cell row_reg[5]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net row_reg[6]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin row_reg[6]_LDC_i_1/O, cell row_reg[6]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net row_reg[7]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin row_reg[7]_LDC_i_1/O, cell row_reg[7]_LDC_i_1.
